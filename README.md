# Use NREL NSRDB Physical Solar Model version 3 in R

The Physical Solar Model version 3 (PSM3) is a satellite-derived dataset hosted on National Solar Radiation DataBase (NSRDB). It contains gridded irradiance estimates using some physical models, as well as a bunch of other meteorological parameters. This repository describes how to use this dataset in R.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you the basic skills to work with PSM3 data in R. 

### Prerequisites

This is an R package, so you need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) on your computer first. In addition, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R; it is highly recommended.
